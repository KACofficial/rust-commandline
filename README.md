# Rust Commandline

Why? idfk I felt like it.  
It was a fun project though.

## how do i run this piece of crap?

- clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/KACofficial/rust-commandline.git`,
- change your directory `cd rust-commandline`,
- updating `data/config/main_conf.json` is highly recommended.
- if necessary install `cargo` (I ain't gonna tell you how to do that use google).
- and run it with `cargo run`, or build it with `cargo build`.
